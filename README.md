# Piiquante
A CRUD Express backend with JWT sign-up and log-in.
Working in TDD with Jest and Supertest. It has file uploading.
With a hexagonal/clean architecture, the domain is completely separate. We can change whether it's using MongoDb or in memory arrays with just a .env variable.
I can also switch Express for something else without having to rewrite the domain.
